# **LLM Prompt & Instruction**

This repository is designed to centralize and store various prompts and instruction files used to guide Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to ensure LLMs produce consistent, precise, and expected results through standardized, high-quality instructions.

## **✨ Core Concepts**

Instructions given to an LLM are like blueprints for a robot. A clear, detailed, and structured instruction can significantly enhance the quality of the LLM's output. This repository aims to create a shared knowledge base, allowing everyone to easily access best-practice prompts.

## **📁 Directory Structure**

All instruction files are stored under the prompts/ directory and are categorized by topic.

.  
├─ prompts/  
│  ├─ coding.md  
│  └─ prompt1.md  
│  └─ prompt2.md  
│  └─ ...  
└─ README.md

## **🚀 How to Use**

To use an instruction from this repository, follow these simple steps:

1. **Browse** the prompts/ folder to find an instruction file that fits your needs.  
2. **Copy** the entire content of the file.  
3. **Paste** the content into your conversation with the LLM.  
4. At the end of the instruction, **append** your specific task or question.

Example:  
Paste the content of coding.md, and then add: "Now, generate a Python function to sort a list of numbers according to the instructions above."
